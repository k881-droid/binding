      The landscape of the contemporary design world is not as smooth and white as some modernists imagined, but the influence of Adolf Loos's Ornament and Crime, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's "less is more", and Le Corbusier's whitewash ideal is still very visible in the applied arts.

    Swiss/French architect, urbanist and designer Le Corbusier can be considered one of the founders of the modern aesthetic, bringing many design ideologies together in his influential modernist grand narrative. Taking cues from Ebenezer Howard's The Garden Cities of Tomorrow (1898) and Adolf Loos's Ornament and Crime (1913), among others, Le Corbusier devised a radical, all-encompassing theory of what the modern world should look like and how its inhabitants should look at it.
